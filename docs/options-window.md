# Options Window and Config

Behaviour changes that landed in PR
[#335](https://github.com/sven-n/MuMain/pull/335) for the options window
and the `config.ini` it writes to.

For the camera architecture see [`camera-system.md`](camera-system.md).

## What changed

The options window is now **the same window in every scene** (login,
character select, gameplay) - it shares one layout, one apply path, and one
backing config object. There is no separate per-scene options dialog.

What was added on top of that:

- **Resolution and windowed/fullscreen toggle apply without restarting.**
  Switch them at any time from the options window.
- **Volume and render-level sliders round to the nearest level** instead of
  truncating, so the slider endpoints actually reach 0 (mute) and the
  configured maximum.
- **Resolution combo-box clicks no longer leak through** to the checkboxes
  behind the dropdown.

## What it stores in `config.ini`

Settings are written next to the executable as `config.ini`. The options
window writes to these sections:

- `[Window]` - width, height, windowed flag.
- `[Graphics]` - render levels, vsync, fps limit.
- `[Audio]` - volumes.
- `[Login]`
- `[ConnectionSettings]`
- `[Camera]` - orbital wheel-zoom radius (`Zoom`). **New in this PR**, the
  only key the camera rework added.

Missing keys fall back to compile-time defaults from
`src/source/Data/GameConfig/GameConfigConstants.h`. If `config.ini` doesn't exist,
it's created the first time anything calls `Save()`.
